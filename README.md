This is Courser Project consists of the following 5 steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

These 5 steps have been applied in R in the file run_analysis.R.
The meaning of the variables, the data and and explanation of the process can be found in the file CodeBook.md
The results of the analysis are in the file tidyData.txt. This is a file where the values are separated by comas.
